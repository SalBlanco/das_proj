Brisbourne\\nSummary: This article presents a weakly supervised machine learning method, which we\\ncall DAS-N2N, for suppressing strong random noise in distributed acoustic\\nsensing (DAS) recordings. DAS-N2N requires no manually produced labels (i.e.,\\npre-determined examples of clean event signals or sections of noise) for\\ntraining and aims to map random noise processes to a chosen summary statistic,\\nsuch as the distribution mean, median or mode, whilst retaining the true\\nunderlying signal. This is achieved by splicing (joining together) two fibres\\nhosted within a single optical cable, recording two noisy copies of the same\\nunderlying signal corrupted by different independent realizations of random\\nobservational noise. A deep learning model can then be trained using only these\\ntwo noisy copies of the data to produce a near fully-denoised copy. Once the\\nmodel is trained, only noisy data from a single fibre is required. Using a\\ndataset from a DAS array deployed on the surface of the Rutford Ice Stream in\\nAntarctica, we demonstrate that DAS-N2N greatly suppresses incoherent noise and\\nenhances the signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of natural microseismic icequake\\nevents. We further show that this approach is inherently more efficient and\\neffective than standard stop/pass band and white noise (e.g., Wiener) filtering\\nroutines, as well as a comparable self-supervised learning method based on\\nmasking individual DAS channels. Our preferred model for this task is\\nlightweight, processing 30 seconds of data recorded at a sampling frequency of\\n1000 Hz over 985 channels (approx. 1 km of fiber) in $<$1 s. Due to the high\\nnoise levels in DAS recordings, efficient data-driven denoising methods, such\\nas DAS-N2N, will prove essential to time-critical DAS earthquake detection,\\nparticularly in the case of microseismic monitoring.\"}, {\"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07260v1\", \"content\": \"Paper ID: 2303.07260v1\\nTitle: Moment tensor inversion of perforation shots using distributed acoustic\\n  sensing\\nAuthor: Biondo Biondi\\nSummary: Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) fibers have enabled various geophysical\\napplications in unconventional reservoirs.

To address this, we propose a two-step deep-learning\\nworkflow with high efficiency and noise immunity for DAS-based traffic\\nmonitoring, focusing on instance vehicle trajectory segmentation and velocity\\nestimation. Our approach begins by generating a diverse synthetic DAS dataset\\nwith labeled vehicle signals, tackling the issue of missing training labels in\\nthis field.

First, we\\nextract 2D patches from both the band-pass filtered data and the CWT scale of\\nthe data. Then, these patches are converted using an unrolling mechanism into\\n1D vectors to form the input of the DL model.

However, the real-world application of\\nDAS is hindered by challenges such as noise contamination and interference\\namong closely traveling cars. In response, we introduce a self-supervised U-Net\\nmodel that can suppress background noise and compress car-induced DAS signals\\ninto high-resolution pulses through spatial deconvolution. Our work extends\\nrecent research by introducing three key advancements. Firstly, we perform a\\ncomprehensive resolution analysis of DAS-recorded traffic signals, laying a\\ntheoretical foundation for our approach. Secondly, we incorporate space-domain\\nvehicle wavelets into our U-Net model, enabling consistent high-resolution\\noutputs regardless of vehicle speed variations. Finally, we employ L-2 norm\\nregularization in the loss function, enhancing our model's sensitivity to\\nweaker signals from vehicles in remote traffic lanes. We evaluate the\\neffectiveness and robustness of our method through field recordings under\\ndifferent traffic conditions and various driving speeds. Our results show that\\nour method can enhance the spatial-temporal resolution and better resolve\\nclosely traveling cars. The spatial deconvolution U-Net model also enables the\\ncharacterization of large-size vehicles to identify axle numbers and estimate\\nthe vehicle length. Monitoring large-size vehicles also benefits imaging deep\\nearth by leveraging the surface waves induced by the dynamic vehicle-road\\ninteraction.\"}, {\"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13138v1\", \"content\": \"Paper ID: 2305.13138v1\\nTitle: Enhancing Understanding of Hydraulic Fracture Tip Advancement through\\n  Inversion of Low-Frequency Distributed Acoustic Sensing Data\\nAuthor: Smaine Zeroug\\nSummary: Characterizing the fluid-driven fracture tip advancing process presents a\\nsignificant challenge due to the difficulty of replicating real-world\\nconditions in laboratory experiments and the lack of precise field\\nmeasurements. However, recent advances in low-frequency distributed acoustic\\nsensing (LF-DAS) technology offer new opportunities to investigate the dynamics\\nof propagating hydraulic fractures. In this study, we propose an iterative\\ninversion method to characterize fracture-tip advancing behaviors using LF-DAS\\ndata. A forward geomechanical model is developed using the three-dimensional\\ndisplacement discontinuity method, and the optimization is realized by a\\nconjugate gradient method. The performance of the inversion algorithm is\\ndemonstrated using a synthetic case, in which the fracture half-length\\nevolution and propagation velocity match well with the reference solutions.\\nAdditionally, the averaged fracture cross-section area, fracture volume, and\\nfracturing fluid efficiency can also be estimated, showing good agreements with\\ntrue values of the synthetic case under reasonable assumptions. Then a field\\ncase with a single-cluster hydraulic fracturing treatment from the Hydraulic\\nFracturing Test Site 2 project (HFTS2) is studied. Our analysis of the\\ninversion results reveal that the fracture propagates intermittently, as\\nevidenced by the fracture half-length evolution. This unique field evidence can\\nguide modeling efforts to incorporate this important physical behavior into\\nfracture models, and the secondary information gathered from the study,\\nincluding fracture cross-section area and volume, can help evaluate and\\noptimize fracturing efficiency.\"}, {\"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14320v3\", \"content\": \"Paper ID: 2408.14320v3\\nTitle: Characterizing Vehicle-Induced Distributed Acoustic Sensing Signals for\\n  Accurate Urban Near-Surface Imaging\\nAuthor: Biondo Biondi\\nSummary: Continuous seismic monitoring of the near-surface structure is crucial for\\nurban infrastructure safety, aiding in the detection of sinkholes, subsidence,\\nand other seismic hazards.

We investigate surface waves generated by vehicles of\\nvarying weights and speeds to provide insights into accurate and efficient\\nnear-surface characterization. We first classify vehicles into light,\\nmid-weight, and heavy based on the maximum amplitudes of quasi-static DAS\\nrecords. Vehicles are also classified by their traveling speed using their\\narrival times at DAS channels. To investigate how vehicle characteristics\\ninfluence the induced surface waves, we extract phase velocity dispersion and\\ninvert the subsurface structure for each vehicle class by retrieving virtual\\nshot gathers (VSGs). Our results reveal that heavy vehicles produce higher\\nsignal-to-noise ratio surface waves, and a sevenfold increase in vehicle weight\\ncan reduce uncertainties in phase velocity measurements from dispersion spectra\\nby up to 3X. Thus, data from heavy vehicles better constrain structures at\\ngreater depths. Additionally, with driving speeds ranging from 5 to 30 meters\\nper second in our study, differences in the dispersion curves due to vehicle\\nspeed are less pronounced than those due to vehicle weight. Our results suggest\\njudiciously selecting and processing surface wave signals from certain vehicle\\ntypes can improve the quality of near-surface imaging in urban environments.\"}, {\"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10678v1\", \"content\": \"Paper ID: 2304.10678v1\\nTitle: Transdimensional surface wave tomography of the near-surface:\\n  Application to DAS data\\nAuthor: Cornelis Weemstra\\nSummary: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) is a novel technology that allows sampling\\nof the seismic wavefield densely over a broad frequency band.

Hubbard\\nSummary: Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is a relatively new technology for\\nrecording stress wave propagation, with promising applications in both\\nengineering and geophysics. DAS's ability to simultaneously collect high\\nspatial resolution data over long arrays suggests that it is especially well\\nsuited for near-surface imaging applications such as 2D MASW (multi-channel\\nanalysis of surface waves). 2D MASW aims to produce a pseudo-2D cross-section\\nof shear-wave velocity (Vs) for the purpose of identifying and characterizing\\nsubsurface layering and anomalies. These cross-sections are produced by\\ninterpolating numerous 1D Vs profiles extracted from overlapping sub-arrays\\nalong the testing alignment. When using traditional seismic equipment, these\\nsub-arrays are typically collected in a roll-along configuration, where the\\nequipment is moved along the alignment at some predetermined sub-array\\ninterval. DAS does not have the same limitations, as data from all shot\\nlocations are simultaneously recorded along the entire length of the DAS array.\\nThis alleviates the requirements to pre-determine sub-array length and interval\\nduring the acquisition stage and allows for multiple geometries to be\\ninvestigated during the processing stage. The present study utilizes DAS data\\nto evaluate the effects of sub-array length on 2D MASW results at a\\nwell-characterized field test site. We organize the DAS waveforms into multiple\\nsets of overlapping MASW sub-arrays of differing lengths, allowing for direct\\ncomparison of the derived results at the same site. We show that the length of\\nthe individual MASW sub-arrays has a significant effect on the resolution of\\nthe resulting cross-sections as well as the resolved location of large\\nimpedance contrasts at our study site and evaluate those locations compared to\\ninvasive testing.\"}, {\"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07135v2\", \"content\": \"Paper ID: 2005.07135v2\\nTitle: Introducing Coherent MIMO Sensing, a fading-resilient,\\n  polarization-independent approach to phase-OTDR\\nAuthor: Jérémie Renaudier\\nSummary: Nowadays, long distance optical fibre transmission systems use polarization\\ndiversity multiplexed signals to enhance transmission performance.
