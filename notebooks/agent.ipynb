Acoustic emission (AE) during filamentation opens a\\ndoor to give the insight into the dynamic evolution of filaments in air. In\\nparticular, the frequency features of the acoustic emission provide relevant\\ninformation on the conversion of laser energy to acoustic energy. Here, the\\nacoustic emission of femtosecond laser filament manipulated by energy and the\\nfocal lengths was measured quantitatively by a broadband microphone, and the\\nacoustic parameters were compared and analyzed. Our results showed that the\\nacoustic power presents a squared dependence on the laser energy and the\\nbandwidth of the acoustic spectrum showed a significant positive correlation\\nwith laser energy deposition. It was found that the spectrum of the acoustic\\npulse emitted from the middle of the filament has a larger bandwidth compared\\nto those emitted from the ends of the filament and the spectrum of the acoustic\\npulse is also an indicator of the filament intensity distribution. These\\nfindings are helpful for studying the plasma filament properties and complex\\ndynamic processes through acoustic parameters and allow the optimization of\\nremote applications.\\n\\nPublished: 2025-02-26\\nTitle: Distributed acoustic sensing for ocean applications\\nAuthors: Angeliki Xenaki, Peter Gerstoft, Ethan Williams, Shima Abadi\\nSummary: Extensive monitoring of acoustic activities is important for many fields,\\nincluding biology, security, oceanography, and Earth science.
